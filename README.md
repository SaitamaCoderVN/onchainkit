# OnchainKit
A collection of beautiful, accessible components commonly used in Solana dApps. You can think of it like [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) but for Solana, where you can easily copy and paste components into your apps.

**Note: This is not a component library.**

Roadmap:
- [ ] Identity
- [ ] Token-related components: token badge, token card, token list, token search
- [ ] NFT components: NFT card, mint NFT
- [ ] Swap
- [ ] Sign transaction
- [ ] Wallet-related components: connect wallet, wallet UI
- [ ] And more...
- [ ] A CLI tool to generate a boilerplate web app that includes the above components, supporting popular frameworks like Next.js, Remix, and Astro.

We also consider for publishing as a library:
- A set of utility functions to support building the above components
- A set of React hooks to handle component logic
=> Why? If developers donâ€™t like our component interfaces, they can use these utility functions and hooks to build their own components.
